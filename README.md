## Team Collaboration & Standards

Maintaining high standards to ensure project quality and smooth development.

### Branching Strategy

- **`main`**: The stable branch. All code here must be production-ready.
- **`feature/[name]`**: Use feature branches for new development.
- **`bugfix/[name]`**: Use bugfix branches for resolving issues.

### Code Review Process

- Every Pull Request (PR) must be reviewed by at least one other team member.
- Ensure `flutter format` is run before submitting a PR.
- Group discussions should precede major architectural changes.

### Coding Style

- Follow the [official Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
- Document complex logic within the code.
